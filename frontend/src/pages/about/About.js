      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        Meeting new people can be a difficult task in University, especially now
        that we are all taking classes from home reducing the chance of meeting
        new people and making new friends. <br />
        <br />
        This is why we created this application, so that students can interact
        with their classmates like they would in person if not more. With
        randomized voice calls after every lecture to strengthen your
        understanding together and get to know the people in your class, to
        class forums to discuss questions, this app makes your room feel less
        lonely during these hard times.
